## MLOps
[ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io)
An open-source MLOps + LLMOps framework that seamlessly integrates existing infrastructure and tools

## LLM Memory / caching
[Letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta?tab=readme-ov-file)
Letta (formerly MemGPT) is a framework for creating LLM services with memory.

[mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
enhances AI assistants and agents with an intelligent memory layer, enabling personalized AI interactions. Mem0 remembers user preferences, adapts to individual needs, and continuously improves over time, making it ideal for customer support chatbots, AI assistants, and autonomous systems.

[memary](https://github.com/kingjulio8238/Memary)
Agents promote human-type reasoning and are a great advancement towards building AGI and understanding ourselves as humans. Memory is a key component of how humans approach tasks and should be weighted the same when building AI agents. memary emulates human memory to advance these agents.

[MemoRAG](https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MemoRAG)
MemoRAG is an innovative RAG framework built on top of a highly efficient, super-long memory model. Unlike standard RAG, which primarily handles queries with explicit information needs, MemoRAG leverages its memory model to achieve a global understanding of the entire database. By recalling query-specific clues from memory, MemoRAG enhances evidence retrieval, resulting in more accurate and contextually rich response generation.​

## State
[Burr](https://burr.dagworks.io/)
Burr makes it easy to develop applications that make decisions (chatbots, agents, simulations, etc...) from simple python building blocks.
Burr works well for any application that uses LLMs, and can integrate with any of your favorite frameworks. Burr includes a UI that can track/monitor/trace your system in real time, along with pluggable persisters (e.g. for memory) to save & load application state.


## LLM inference
[Guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance)
Guidance is an efficient programming paradigm for steering language models. With Guidance, you can control how output is structured and get high-quality output for your use case—while reducing latency and cost vs. conventional prompting or fine-tuning. It allows users to constrain generation (e.g. with regex and CFGs) as well as to interleave control (conditionals, loops, tool use) and generation seamlessly.

[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
The main goal of llama.cpp is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

## RAG frameworks
[llmware](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware)
provides a unified framework for building LLM-based applications (e.g., RAG, Agents), using small, specialized models that can be deployed privately, integrated with enterprise knowledge sources safely and securely, and cost-effectively tuned and adapted for any business process.

## LLM risk assessment
[Guardrails](https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails?tab=readme-ov-file)
Guardrails runs Input/Output Guards in your application that detect, quantify and mitigate the presence of specific types of risks. To look at the full suite of risks, check out [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/).
Guardrails help you generate structured data from LLMs.

## LLM Routers
[Aurelio](https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router)
Semantic Router is a superfast decision-making layer for your LLMs and agents. Rather than waiting for slow LLM generations to make tool-use decisions, we use the magic of semantic vector space to make those decisions — routing our requests using semantic meaning.

[aisuite](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite)
makes it easy for developers to use multiple LLM through a standardized interface. Using an interface similar to OpenAI's, aisuite makes it easy to interact with the most popular LLMs and compare the results. It is a thin wrapper around python client libraries, and allows creators to seamlessly swap out and test responses from different LLM providers without changing their code. 

## IDEs
[Free Bolt](https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm)
This fork of Bolt.new (oTToDev) allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK! See the instructions below for running this locally and extending it to include more models.

## rerankers
[rerankers](https://github.com/answerdotai/rerankers)
A lightweight unified API for various reranking models. 

## Documentation

## MCP
[Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main)
A collection of reference implementations and community-contributed servers for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP). This repository showcases the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.

## Distributed LLMs
[Exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)
Run your own AI cluster at home with everyday devices

## Knowledge Graphs
[itext2KG](https://github.com/AuvaLab/itext2kg)
iText2KG is a Python package designed to incrementally construct consistent knowledge graphs with resolved entities and relations by leveraging large language models for entity and relation extraction from text documents. It features zero-shot capability, allowing for knowledge extraction across various domains without specific training. The package includes modules for document distillation, entity extraction, and relation extraction, ensuring resolved and unique entities and relationships. It continuously updates the KG with new documents and integrates them into Neo4j for visual representation.

## Chunking
[Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-ai/chonkie)
